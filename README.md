# PedCoins
This project will be to inform and educate the pedestrian and walking communities on how they can further put their walkability efforts to use and benefiting by erthereum.
Walkability and Pedestrianism work together with health and Safety. Both in which I support dearly along with Pathway's to Right-of=Way's Inc.,  which carries it's mission to raise awareness to these efforts!
